A web application that leverages the Window object to display various system and window-related information, as well as battery-related details to the user. It offers valuable insights into the user's environment, such as their operating system, language preferences, and browser specifications. Additionally, the application provides real-time updates on the window's dimensions and orientation, making it adaptable to different device types and screen sizes. Users can also monitor their device's battery status, including the battery level and charging status, all within the convenience of a web browser.
